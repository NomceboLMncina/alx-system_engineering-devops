Postmortem: The Great Checkout Catastrophe
Issue Summary
- **Duration:** 4 hours (10:00 AM - 2:00 PM UTC, February 26, 2025).  
- **Impact:** Users were unable to complete purchases on the checkout page. Approximately 40% of users were affected, leading to a collective sigh of frustration and a noticeable dip in sales.  
- **Root Cause:** A rogue deployment introduced a bug in the payment processing microservice, causing it to crash whenever a user tried to pay with a credit card.

### **Timeline**  
- **10:00 AM** - The issue was detected when our monitoring system screamed, "503 errors are through the roof!" (Okay, it didnâ€™t scream, but it might as well have).  
- **10:05 AM** - The engineering team was alerted. Caffeine levels were already high, but this was about to go next level.  
- **10:15 AM** - Initial assumption: The database was on strike. The team checked database logs and connection pools, but everything seemed fine.  
- **10:30 AM** - Misleading path: The team investigated the application server, suspecting a memory leak. Turns out, the server was just fineâ€”no leaks here, just a lot of confusion.  
- **10:45 AM** - Further investigation revealed that the payment processing microservice was crashing every time a user tried to pay with a credit card.  
- **11:00 AM** - The issue was escalated to the DevOps team, who muttered something about "rogue deployments" and "why does this always happen on my watch?"  
- **11:30 AM** - Root cause identified: A recent deployment introduced a bug in the payment processing microservice. The code was trying to divide by zero when processing credit card payments. Math, why do you betray us?  
- **12:00 PM** - The DevOps team rolled back the deployment faster than you can say, "Oops, my bad."  
- **12:30 PM** - The fix was deployed, and the payment processing microservice started behaving like a responsible adult again.  
- **2:00 PM** - Full service was restored, and users were finally able to give us their money.

### **Root Cause and Resolution**  
- **Root Cause:**  
  A recent deployment introduced a bug in the payment processing microservice. Specifically, the code attempted to divide by zero when processing credit card payments. This caused the microservice to crash, leaving users unable to complete their purchases.  

- **Resolution:**  
  The DevOps team rolled back the faulty deployment and restored the previous stable version of the microservice. They also added a check to ensure that division by zero would never happen again. The payment processing microservice was back online, and users could finally give us their hard-earned cash.

### **Corrective and Preventative Measures**  
To ensure this doesnâ€™t happen again (because letâ€™s face it, we donâ€™t want another "Great Checkout Catastrophe"), the following measures will be implemented:  

1. **Broad Improvements:**  
   - Conduct a thorough review of all deployment processes to ensure bugs like this donâ€™t slip through again.  
   - Improve testing procedures for payment processing to catch division-by-zero errors before they reach production.  
   - Add better monitoring and alerting for microservice crashes.  

2. **Specific Tasks (TODO List):**  
   - Update the payment processing microservice to handle edge cases (like division by zero) gracefully.  
   - Add automated tests for payment processing to catch similar bugs in the future.  
   - Document the deployment rollback process so it can be done even faster next time.  
   - Hold a team meeting to discuss what went wrong and how we can avoid it in the future. (Snacks will be provided.)

### **How to Make It Attractive (Task 1 - Advanced)**  
To make the postmortem more engaging, Iâ€™ve added humor throughout the document. Here are some examples:  
1. **Humor:**  
   - "The monitoring system screamed, '503 errors are through the roof!'"  
   - "Math, why do you betray us?"  
   - "Users were finally able to give us their money."  

2. **Diagram:**  
   You can include a simple diagram to show the flow of the issue:  
   ```
   Before Fix:  
   User â†’ Checkout Page â†’ Payment Microservice â†’ ðŸ’¥ (Division by Zero) â†’ Crash  

   After Fix:  
   User â†’ Checkout Page â†’ Payment Microservice â†’ âœ… (No Division by Zero) â†’ Success!
